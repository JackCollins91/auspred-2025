<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>This forecasting model is based on a research paper authored by me, John Collins (2025). In that paper, I demonstrated that these models could have retrospectively predicted Australian federal elections from 2010 to 2022 with greater accuracy than the traditional Mackerras Pendulum. However, those predictions were made after the fact (although striving to replicate the information available at the time).  </p>
<p>This marks the first instance of applying these models "for real," making it an experiment to assess their performance under real forecasting conditions.  </p>
<p>While some level of inaccuracy is inevitable, the key question is whether this model outperforms alternative forecasting approaches. In Australia, the Mackerras Pendulum remains the primary election forecasting model—<a href="https://antonygreen.com.au/fed25-election-new-seat-margins-and-electoral-pendulums/">Antony Green's adaptation</a> is an excellent example. Additionally, YouGov may publish another MRP forecast, which will be worth reviewing alongside other independent forecasters.  </p>
<h3>Benefits of This Model</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rigorously Tested</strong>: The foundational research paper (Collins, 2025) compared this method to numerous alternatives, confirming its superiority.  </li>
<li><strong>Proven Historical Accuracy</strong>: It consistently outperformed the Pendulum for elections from 2010 to 2022, offering optimism for 2025.  </li>
<li><strong>Low Cost &amp; Reproducibility</strong>: The model operates on a budget of $0, relying solely on publicly available data. Anyone with coding skills can replicate or experiment with it.  </li>
<li><strong>Timeliness</strong>: Forecasts reached peak accuracy six to three months before an election, potentially leaving enough time to influence outcomes.  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Why Election Forecasting Matters</h3>
<p>Accurately predicting election outcomes can empower voters to act strategically. By revealing which seats and issues matter most before the election, voters gain an additional opportunity to influence politicians' priorities.  </p>

<p>Final note: The forecast uses data from polls from December 3rd to 17th 2024
    but I didn't get around to creating this forecast until January 16th. I'll try and be closer
    to the inference time from now on!.

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>As of <strong>December 17th, 2024</strong>, this forecasting model predicts the following for the <strong>Australian Federal Election on May 17th, 2025</strong>:<br />
- <strong>100% chance</strong> that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) will win the most seats in the Lower House.<br />
- <strong>37.1% chance</strong> that the ALP will form a majority government (≥76 seats).  </p>
<p>This is based on an estimated swing of <strong>2.76</strong> against the ALP. </p>

<h2>Reliability of the Forecast</h2>
<p>This is the first real-world test of this model, making it experimental.  </p>
<h3>Historical Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: At six months lead time for elections from 2010 to 2022, the model's seat-count predictions had errors ranging from:  </li>
<li><strong>Overestimating ALP by 4 seats (2022)</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Underestimating ALP by 16 seats (2016)</strong>  </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these errors, the model correctly predicted which party won the most seats in all elections except 2019, where it forecasted a slim ALP majority (a closer result than the Pendulum's predicted ALP landslide).  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seat-Level Accuracy</strong>: The model achieves <strong>88% accuracy</strong> for individual seat predictions, slightly outperforming the Mackerras Pendulum (87%)—a difference of approximately 1.5 seats. Noteably, in 2019, the Pendulum mis-classified 26 seats, while this ML model only misclassified 11. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Potential Weaknesses</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Crossbench Complexity</strong>: With an unusually large crossbench (15 seats), both this model and the Pendulum struggle to predict outcomes for seats held by or likely to be won by non-major parties.  </li>
<li><strong>Teal Independents</strong>: The rise of Teal Independents presents a unique challenge, as historical data may fail to capture this new dynamic.  </li>
<li><strong>Redistribution Effects</strong>: Changes due to redistributions, such as the creation of the Western Australian seat of Bullwinkel, pose additional uncertainty. For Bullwinkel, I used margin estimates by <a href="https://antonygreen.com.au/fed25-election-new-seat-margins-and-electoral-pendulums/">Antony Green</a> rather than historical data.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>How the Models Work</h2>
<h3>Overview of the Approach</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Polling Data</strong>:  </li>
<li>Calculate the Two-Party-Preferred (2PP) polling swing between the ALP and LNP using <a href="https://www.pollbludger.net/fed2025/bludgertrack/polldata.htm">Poll Bludger</a>.  </li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate state-level 2PP polls where available.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pendulum Predictions</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>Use 2PP swings to predict seat changes based on the Mackerras Pendulum.  </li>
<li>
<p>Crossbench seats are assumed to remain with incumbents.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>An <strong>Extra Trees Classifier</strong> refines pendulum predictions using additional features, including:  <ul>
<li>Polling data  </li>
<li>Demographic data (e.g., rent, unemployment)  </li>
<li>Economic indicators (GDP growth, inflation)  </li>
<li>Historical election results  </li>
<li>State/Territory identifiers  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train the model on data from the previous two elections to predict outcomes for 2025.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simulations</strong>:  </p>
</li>
<li>For each seat, calculate the probability of being won by ALP, LNP, or OTH.  </li>
<li>Simulate 1,000 elections based on these probabilities to estimate possible seat distributions.  </li>
<li>Calculate the percentage of simulations in which the ALP (as the incumbent) won majority or had the most seats. </li>
</ol>
